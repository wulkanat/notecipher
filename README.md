# NoteCipher

A simple and secure note taking app previously known as notepadbot.

This is a fork and partial rewrite and modernization
of the original NoteCipher in order to make it work on modern Android versions
(and look a little nicer).

Showcase app for [SQLCipher for Android](http://sqlcipher.net/sqlcipher-for-android) and [CacheWord](https://github.com/guardianproject/cacheword).
